# Restaurant Programming Exercises (Python Fundamentals)

This notebook contains a series of small Python exercises using a restaurant-themed dataset.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate understanding of core Python concepts without external libraries.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Loops (`for`)
- Conditional logic (`if / else`)
- Basic aggregation (sum, average, max)
- Iteration with `.items()` and `enumerate()`

**All tasks were completed using python in Jupyter Notebook.**
